## Try it out yourself

There are interactive notebooks for this [project](https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/cloud-price-analysis-public) available for anyone to start using on the public [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub-opf-jupyterhub.apps.smaug.na.operate-first.cloud) instance on the [Massachusetts Open Cloud](https://massopen.cloud/) (MOC) right now!

1. To get started, access [JupyterHub](https:/jupyterhub-opf-jupyterhub.apps.smaug.na.operate-first.cloud), select log in with `operate-first` and sign in using your Github Account.
2. After signing in, on the spawner page, please select the `Cloud Price Analysis Notebook Image` image in the JupyterHub Notebook Image section from the dropdown and select a `Medium` container size and hit `Start` to start your server.
3. Once your server has spawned, you should see a directory titled `cloud-price-analysis-public-<current-timestamp>`.
4. Go to `notebooks/experimental` and start with the notebook named cloud-price-analysis-EDA.ipynb.ipynb.
5. Here's a video that presents a brief description of the project and how to get started.
